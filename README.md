# Loot Table FHE: Encrypted RPG Loot Management 

Loot Table FHE is a revolutionary role-playing game (RPG) where the core loot tables are secured using **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**. In this dynamic environment, players can not only enjoy an immersive gaming experience but also have the ability to influence their loot outcomes in a safe and confidential manner.

## The Challenge of Traditional Loot Systems

In traditional RPGs, loot tables are publicly accessible, leading to predictable outcomes and potential exploitation. Players often exploit known loot mechanics, creating an imbalanced economy that diminishes the overall game experience. Developers face the challenge of keeping the game engaging while ensuring fairness and security in loot distribution.

## The FHE Solution: Privacy Meets Interactivity

By integrating **Zama's FHE**, Loot Table FHE ensures that loot tables remain encrypted and inaccessible to unauthorized users while allowing players to modify them through an interface. This means players can use rare materials to "enchant" the encrypted loot tables, permanently and homomorphically increasing the drop rates of specific items. This new paradigm fosters an engaging, player-driven economy, where both players and developers can collaboratively evolve the game world.

The FHE implementation leverages Zama's open-source libraries, specifically the **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, thus allowing for advanced encryption techniques that don't compromise performance.

## Core Functionalities

- **Encrypted Loot Tables**: Ensure players' loot tables are protected from tampering or exploitation.
- **Player Modifications**: Players can enchant loot probabilities, affecting their entire server's economy.
- **Engaged Community**: Create a collaborative environment where developers and players actively participate in the gameâ€™s growth.
- **Complete Transparency**: Players can see the effects of their modifications while maintaining overall security.

## Technology Stack

The Loot Table FHE project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum smart contracts for game logic.
- **Zama FHE SDK**: For all encryption and decryption processes.
- **Node.js**: To run the server-side code.
- **Hardhat**: For compiling and deploying smart contracts.

## Getting Started: Installation Guide

To get started with Loot Table FHE, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: 
   - Ensure you have **Node.js** installed (version 14.x or higher).
   - Install **Hardhat** globally using npm if not already available.

2. **Setup**: 
   - Download the project files (no `git clone` or URLs).
   - Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. **Install Dependencies**: 
   Run the following command to install all required packages, including Zama FHE libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Build & Run Instructions

Once the dependencies are installed, you can compile and run the project:

1. **Compile Smart Contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Deploy Smart Contracts**:
   Use the script provided in the `scripts` directory to deploy the contracts.
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-network>
   ```

3. **Run the Game Server**:
   Start the server to allow players to interact with the game.
   ```bash
   node src/index.js
   ```

4. **Testing**: 
   After deploying, ensure your functionalities are working correctly:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

## Example Code Snippet

The following code demonstrates how a player can enchant the loot table in Loot Table FHE:

```javascript
const { encryptLootTable, enchantLootProbability } = require('./src/enchant');

async function main() {
    const lootTable = await getLootTable();
    const encryptedLootTable = encryptLootTable(lootTable);
    
    const playerMaterials = 5; // example rarity materials
    const enchantmentSuccess = await enchantLootProbability(encryptedLootTable, playerMaterials);

    if (enchantmentSuccess) {
        console.log("Loot table successfully enchanted!");
    } else {
        console.log("Enchantment failed, try again!");
    }
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

In this snippet, players can safely encrypt and modify loot probabilities while maintaining confidentiality, ensuring that the gameplay remains fair and unpredictable.
